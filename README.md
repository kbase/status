KBase is currently UP.

Our data center will be performing network maintenance Friday, June 24, to Monday, June 27, 2022.  All KBase services, including narrative.kbase.us, appdev.kbase.us, and all compute jobs will be unavailable during this time.  We will begin shutting down services at approximately 2pm CDT (12pm PDT) on June 24.  We hope to be able to start up on the morning of June 27.

www.kbase.us and status.kbase.us will not be affected by this work.
