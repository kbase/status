UPDATE July 31, 2:15pm CDT: our data center has been unable to bring up its networking hardware.  As a result we are unable to begin powering up our systems.  We do not know when the issue will be fixed, but we will post an update when we have more information.

Our data center will be performing power maintenance on July 28-31, 2023.Â  We will be shutting down almost all of KBase on July 28, 2023, starting at approximately 11am CDT (9am PDT), and will bring our systems back up as soon as possible on July 31.
